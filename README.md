## Overview üêù
[**Honeygain-Pot**](https://bit.ly/3x6nX1S) üçØ is a script (bot) powered by NodeJS, JavaScript and Shell scripting to automatically claim your lucky pot bonus daily from [**Honeygain**](https://bit.ly/3x6nX1S)üêù.

The script is designed to be run in a docker environment, allowing it to be deployed alongside the Honeygain docker container.

It uses very minimal resources, resulting in the CPU utilisation staying at idle **0%** the entire time unless logging into the website.
```

> This script comes pre-bundled with [**Income Generator**](https://github.com/XternA/income-generator). A tool which consolidates and earns passive income from multiple sources.

## Usage üìÉ
Define the following environment variable to bootstrap the image.

| Variable | Description | Mandatory |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **EMAIL**     | Your Honeygain email address    | YES |
| **PASSWORD**  | Your Honeygain password         | YES |

Or supply credentials in a Dotenv `.env` file.
```markdown
EMAIL=<email_address>
PASSWORD=<password_credential>
```

## Docker Deployment üêã
### Docker Compose
Via `compose.yml`
```yaml
services:
  honeygain-pot:
    container_name: honeygain-pot
    image: xterna/honeygain-pot
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - EMAIL=$EMAIL
      - PASSWORD=$PASSWORD
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8
```

With Honeygain app docker image.
```yaml
services:
  honeygain:
    container_name: honeygain
    image: honeygain/honeygain
    restart: always
    command: -tou-accept -email $EMAIL -pass $PASSWORD -device $<name_to_identify_device>
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8

  honeygain-pot:
    container_name: honeygain-pot
    image: xterna/honeygain-pot
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - EMAIL=$EMAIL
      - PASSWORD=$PASSWORD
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8
    depends_on:
      - honeygain
```

Execute where compose file is located.
```yaml
docker compose up -d
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** If you apply resource limits such as CPU and RAM you need to set the following bare minimum:
```
  - cpu=0.6
  - mem_limit=200m
```
The script won't be able to run and will constantly timeout if the CPU limit is set anything lower than recommended. This is only required during the bootup phase where it needs to spin up a headless browser to connect to the site. Resource is most intensive during this phase.

### Docker run
Via environment variable or Dotenv `.env` defined e.g.
```sh
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name honeygain-pot -e EMAIL=$HONEYGAIN_EMAIL -e PASSWORD=$HONEYGAIN_PASSWORD xterna/honeygain-pot
```

Via directly passing credentials.
```sh
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name honeygain-pot -e EMAIL=example.gmail.com -e PASSWORD=pass123 xterna/honeygain-pot
```
This will start the application in the background. The alias assigned is `honeygain-pot`.
